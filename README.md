# Data Visualisation Project

Through this project, I gained hands-on experiences on how to visualise data and create dashboards through python and Jupyter notebook. I also learned how to effectively extract data insights and plan out recommendations for tourism marketing. 

### Project Overview

Aims to attract more travellers to Singapore and go for local tours by using effective and targeted marketing.

*Dashboards are hosted on seperate domains, click on links below them to view*

### Data Source

Indonesian travellers visiting Singapore from 2014 to 2015
- Some cleaning was done beforehand to make visuals easier to understand and plot

### Data Visualisation and Insights

#### Dashboard 1: Overview
- It contains a pie chart displaying the Stay durations of the travellers, a horizontal bar chart displaying the total amount spent by travellers of each purpose of travel and an interactive scatter map plot below to display the cities the travellers are coming from and the average amount they spend.

Insights
- Indonesian travellers like to spend 1-7 days in Singapore
- Leisure has the highest amount expenditure
- Jakarta is our largest market and Yogyakarta is a city with a good number of travellers and a high average spending
 
#### Dashboard 2: First time and revisiting

- The dashboard contains data indicators / Big Numbers at the top for easy side-by-side comparisons of first time and revisiting data, it is color coded with biege being for first visit and olive for revisiting. The grouped bar chart shows the counts of visits for each purpose between first time and revisiting travellers. The two pie charts show the percentage of stay durations for the two types of travellers.

Insights
- value percent difference between first time and revisiting for Healthcare is the greatest amongst all categories
- Leisure is the most common purpose for both first time and revisiting
- The average spending of revisitors is higher than first timers by ~$300 with much more revisitors in 2014 to 2015 than first timers

### Recommendations
1. Appeal to the first timers:
 - Advertise leisure destinations and events 
 - Short holiday trips (between 1 to 7 day trips)
 - Advertise in big cities like Jakarta and Batam due to their large markets
 - May be better to advertise shorter trips with distinct individual places instead of long guided trips 
 - Example: Sentosa, Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay

2. Appeal to revisitors:
 - For leisure, can advertise longer guided trips with focus on good individual spots due to more preference for longer stays than first timers, but with majority still prefering 1-7 day trips
 - Advertise in big yet high spending average cities like Yogyakarta
 - Revisitors on average spend more, it might be better to bring to more chic and bougie areas of Singapore
 - Example: Arab Street, Clarke Quay, Nation-side Islands
 - For Healthcare, promote premium healthcare services, specialist clinics, private hospitals
 - For example: Aromatic Therapy Tour, Informative Medical Tours
